# Favorite number
This is a simples project based on exercises 10.11 and 10.12 from the Python Crash Course book.  
Three functions were created, but only `show_number()` is called in the `main.py` file. The functions are explaneid bellow:  
- `save_numbe()`: this function saves a number chosen by the user in a json file.
- `read_number()`: this funcition reads the number saved in the json file. If the file doesn't exist will return `None` otherwise wil return this number.
- `show_number()`: this function will display the number saved for the user. if the user didn't inform a number previously he/she will be ask to type his/her favorite number.
